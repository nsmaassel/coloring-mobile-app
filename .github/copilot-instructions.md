# coloring-mobile-app Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2025-11-09

## Active Technologies

- Swift 5.9+ (latest stable, bundled with Xcode 15+)
- SwiftUI (primary UI framework with UIKit interop for drawing canvas)
- PencilKit (Apple Pencil drawing framework, optimized for low latency)
- File-based storage (FileManager + Codable for artwork persistence)
- PHPickerViewController (iOS 14+ photo picker for importing custom coloring pages)
- XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- Target: iOS 15.0+ on iPad

## Commands

### Build & Run
- Build and run in simulator: `Cmd+R` in Xcode
- Build only: `Cmd+B` in Xcode
- Clean build: `Cmd+Shift+K` in Xcode
- Run tests: `Cmd+U` in Xcode
- Profile with Instruments: `Cmd+I` in Xcode

### Deployment
- Deploy to physical iPad: Connect via USB, select device, `Cmd+R`
- Archive for TestFlight: Product → Archive in Xcode

## Code Style

### Swift Conventions
- Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use SwiftUI naming conventions: `View` suffix for views, `ViewModel` suffix for view models
- Protocols: `Protocol` suffix (e.g., `ColoringPageRepositoryProtocol`)
- Use `MARK:` comments to organize code sections
- Prefer `let` over `var` for immutability
- Use explicit types for clarity in complex scenarios
- Async/await for asynchronous operations (Swift 5.5+)

### Architecture Patterns
- MVVM for UI layers (Model-View-ViewModel)
- Protocol-oriented design for repositories and services
- Dependency injection via protocol conformance
- Feature-based modular organization

## Specialized Agents

This project includes specialized GitHub Copilot agents for domain-specific assistance:

- **[ios-developer](./agents/ios-developer.md)** - General iOS development, Swift, frameworks, Xcode
- **[swiftui-expert](./agents/swiftui-expert.md)** - SwiftUI views, state management, layouts
- **[pencilkit-specialist](./agents/pencilkit-specialist.md)** - Apple Pencil, drawing, performance optimization
- **[testing-specialist](./agents/testing-specialist.md)** - XCTest, UI testing, TDD practices
- **[architecture-guide](./agents/architecture-guide.md)** - MVVM, protocols, dependency injection

See [agents/README.md](./agents/README.md) for detailed usage instructions and agent coordination.

## Recent Changes

- 2025-11-09: Added GitHub Copilot agent configurations for specialized iOS development assistance
- 001-coloring-pages: Added Swift 5.9+ with SwiftUI + PencilKit architecture for iPad drawing app with Apple Pencil support
